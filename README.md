Nix is an open source software available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. The model has been derived from scratch with a clear Application Programming Interface (API). It is written in C/C++ for efficiency and extremely fast computing (see Appendix \ref{computation}) and is readily available to run in any High Performance Computing Cluster. There are two key dependencies: NetCDF \citep[][]{Rew1990, Brown1993}{}{} and Eigen \citep[][]{eigenweb}{}{} libraries. The former handles tasks for convenient community-standard input/output capability, whereas the latter serves to define vectors, matrices and further necessary computations (Fig. \ref{fig:flowline_code}). Nix users can optionally select parallel computing (supported by Eigen library) simply by enabling OpenMP on the employed compiler, particularly convenient for high resolutions in the Blatter-Pattyn approximation, where large sparse matrices must be inverted. Moreover, it is also possible to use Eigen's matrices, vectors, and arrays for fixed size within CUDA kernels \citep[][]{Nickolls2008}{}{}.
